📌 Implement a Classification Model Using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

🔍 Description
This project focuses on building and comparing two powerful classification models: **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier**. It aims to demonstrate how each model performs on the same dataset, analyzing their accuracy, interpretability, and decision boundaries.  

⚙️ Tech Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🖥️ Visual Studio Code (VSC)  
- 📦 `sklearn.linear_model` → `LogisticRegression`  
- 🌳 `sklearn.tree` → `DecisionTreeClassifier`  
- 🎯 `sklearn.metrics` → `accuracy_score`

🎯 Output & Accuracy
Both models were trained on the same dataset and evaluated using accuracy score.  
- The output includes:  
  ✅ Graphical comparison of decision boundaries  
  ✅ Accuracy print statements in the terminal
